Once upon a time...Ted McDonald took off his shoes and started running. It inspired him to realize humans were perfectly adapted for running in their original equipment. He got fascinated with the history of running and solutions to running found all over the world. Following the "natural selection" of footwear in human cultures, he kept seeing the simple sandal crop up as "the solution" used by humans since prehistoric times up until now.

Located in historic downtown Auburn, California, our success is marked by a return to the good old fashioned, hands-on customer service style of shop keeping lost in today’s impersonal, shopping mall-inspired approach to retail. Sit back and relax in our historical movie theater seats while we take personal care to find the best fitting shoe based on your foot type and training requirements. Regardless of whether you are walking for exercise or to help raise money for a cure, training for your first 5K or ultramarathon, or just like wearing running shoes because they feel so darn good, our mission is to find the right fit so you can reach your goals and enjoy the journey.

Brian and Lisa Ford knew they were creating something very special with their craft beer pub in historic Old Town Auburn, and they sought to develop a menu that was as unique as their landmark building. “We’ve had a lot of experience surprising people,” Brian said. “So we wanted to go far beyond the ‘pizza-pasta-beer’ formula you see in so many brew pubs.”

Auburn Ale House will be providing beer mugs & a free beer to all racers & volunteers at this year's Overlook Endurance Run series! Make sure you get yours!
