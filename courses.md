Something for one and all. Generous time limit so one can fully enjoy the beauty of the Western States Trail. All events start in the historic town on Foresthill.

Runs starts with the scenic beauty of Volcano and El Dorado Canyon. The route into El Dorado utilizes the service fireroad into the canyon. The service road alleviates congestion and adds great views of the canyon never used on running events. Turning around at the bottom of El Dorado Canyon the course rejoins the Western States Trail returning to Foresthill. From Foresthill the Western States Endurance Run Trail, Tevis Cup Endurance Ride and a small segment of the old Cool Canyon Crawl Course are transversed on the way to the finish at the Auburn Overlook.

Can you say hybrid? This course was designed to combine parts of the 100 km and 50 km routes.  Starts with the 100 km runners and leaves them at Poverty for a run along the American River, following the Tevis Cup Endurance Ride course to the Overlook. Shorter, less climbing but just as scenic as the 100 km course.

Great first time and personal record course. Follows the historic Tevis Cup Ride Route. Great introduction to California Trail with the Race Directors favorite views of the American Canyon River. Sweep past the runner crossing on the Middle fork of American River and experience how the horses cross, tamer and shallower. Poverty Bar, (how did that get itâ€™s name), follow American River to the historic No Hands Bridge and on wards to the finish.
