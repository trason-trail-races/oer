<p><strong>Update</strong>: Results are currently being worked on and will be updated to Ultrasignup later today.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: We are accepting race day signups! However, due to limited capacity, we are not able to offer the shuttle service <strong>for race day signups</strong> from the finish line at Auburn Dam Overlook to the start line at Stone's Brew. You will need to go directly to Stone's Brew at 24482 Main St. Foresthill. Race day signups and checkin are as follows:</p>
<p>
<li>100km/50m: 5:00am to 5:45am</li>
<li>50km: 7:00am to 7:45am</li>
</p>
<p>We are taking online signups, including shuttle service, until Wednesday night, September 3rd.
